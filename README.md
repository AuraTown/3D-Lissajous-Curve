# 3D-Lissajous-Curve
A music visualization component using a 2D or 3D Lissajous curve to show how music note frequencies connects.





# 🌈🎵   Where Math Meets Music! 🎶🔬

We're turning MIDI notes into 3D visual   🍭✨
This is a component of the [Aura music app](https://aura.town/), where we mix interactive controls with sweet data viz.

## 🎭 About Aura Town

Hey there! We're Aura Town, a groovy group of tech and music enthusiasts. We're on a mission to create mind-bending tools for playing and learning music. If you're into building the future of music tech, come jam with us! 🎸🚀

## 🎨 What's This Lissajous Madness?

This Vue component is like a magic wand that transforms boring ol' MIDI notes into a trippy 3D light show. It's part math, part music, and 100% awesome!

### 🌟 Key Features :
- Shape-shifting powers! Goes from 1D circles to 2D curves to full 3D craziness
- Custom shaders that make it look like a neon rave in space
- Camera controls that let you zoom and swoop like a DJ at a geometry party

## 🏗️ Current State of Affairs

Look, we're not gonna lie - this baby's got some quirks. But hey, that's what makes it exciting, right?

1. It's a bit of a drama queen - redraws the WHOLE curve when you change a note. Talk about high maintenance!
2. There's a sneaky bug that makes the animation speed up if you change notes too fast. We're calling it the "Caffeinated Curve" feature.
3. It's a bit of a CPU hog when you're playing back. Think of it as a workout for your computer!

## 🚀 The Future is Bright (and Curvy)!

We've got big plans for this little curve:
- Teaching it to chill out and not redraw everything all the time
- Sending that speedy animation bug to rehab
- Making it play nice with CPUs everywhere

## 🤝 Join the fun!

We're looking for collaborators!
